<h1>David Lee Cordle</h1>
<p>
An explanation: I have extremely limited experience with web pages, so for this project /n
I Googled how to build html documents, Opened up notepad, and repeatedly tried to see what /n
worked and what didn't work, untill i built the page. The images where edited with the /n
suggested site Deepart.io, and a few other existing images where added for the sake of /n
being thorough. Publishing it took a couple of tries, as i had to find that github is capable of /n
publishing sites through a few google searches, then sifted through the docs that Github has in place /n
in order to successfully publish this site.
