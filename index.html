<h1>David Lee Cordle</h1>
<p>
An explanation: I have an extremely limited amount of experience with web pages, so for this project
I Googled how to build html documents, opened up notepad, and repeatedly tried to see what 
worked and what didn't work until the page was completed. The images where edited with the 
suggested site Deepart.io, and a few other existing images where added for the sake of 
being thoroughly visable. Publishing it took a couple of tries, as I had to find that github is capable of 
publishing sites through a few google searches, then sifted through the docs that Github has in place 
in order to successfully publish this site. This process took about 45 minutes to an hour.
